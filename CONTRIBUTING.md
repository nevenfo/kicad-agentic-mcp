# Contributing to Konnect

Thanks for your interest! Bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests are welcome.

## Before you start

- Check [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) — your idea may already be planned (or intentionally
  out of scope).
- For anything non-trivial, open an issue first so we can agree on the approach before
  you invest time.
- Keep each pull request focused on one reviewable outcome. Split unrelated platform,
  protocol, feature, and documentation changes into a short PR series.
- Read [docs/NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md](docs/NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md) before adding public
  tools, schema fields, CLI options, environment variables, or user-facing terms.

## Development setup

```bash
# protoc is required for protobuf code generation (kicad-ipc crate)
# Windows: choco install protoc   /   macOS: brew install protobuf   /   Linux: apt install protobuf-compiler

cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace --lib --tests
cargo build --release -p konnect
```

See [DEV.md](DEV.md) for the architecture guide, tool conventions, and how to add a
new tool.

## Pull request shape

Use an imperative title such as `fix(schematic): preserve tab-indented wire blocks`.
The description should state:

1. the user-visible problem and scope;
2. the root cause and chosen design;
3. compatibility or migration effects;
4. tests run, including intentionally skipped environment-dependent checks;
5. risk and rollback notes for file formats, IPC, packaging, or release changes.

Treat MCP tools, schema fields, CLI flags, environment variables, config keys, and
documented paths as public API. Preserve compatibility or provide an explicit
migration. Keep generated artifacts, personal settings, downloaded catalogs, build
output, and unrelated cleanup out of the diff.

## Pull request checklist

These are exactly the commands CI runs — if they pass locally, CI should be green:

- `cargo test --workspace --locked --lib --tests` passes
- `cargo test --workspace --locked --doc` passes
- `cargo clippy --workspace --locked -- -D warnings` is clean
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` is clean
- New names follow [the naming conventions](docs/NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md); public name
  changes include compatibility handling and migration notes
- If you added or removed tools: update `tool_count` in `router/registry.rs`,
  regenerate the matching section of `tool-directory.md`, and update the total tool
  counts in DEV.md's "Current Stats" and the README — those three counts have
  drifted apart before precisely because only one of them got updated. Two more
  places assert the same number and are easy to miss: the bundled skill
  (`crates/konnect/assets/skills/konnect/SKILL.md`), which ships to users, and
  `packaging/metadata.json`, which ships to the PCM. The one inside
  `find_capabilities`'s own description is covered by a test
  (`router::tests::find_capabilities_description_quotes_the_real_corpus_size`) —
  it will fail before review does

First PR from a fork? CI workflows may sit at "waiting for approval" until a
maintainer approves the run — that's a GitHub setting for first-time contributors,
not a failure on your part.

## Contributor License Agreement

Konnect is dual-licensed: AGPL-3.0 for the community, with commercial licenses
available for organizations that can't comply with the AGPL (see
[COMMERCIAL.md](COMMERCIAL.md)). To make that possible, the project must be able to
relicense contributed code.

By submitting a contribution, you agree that:

1. You have the right to submit the work under the project's licenses.
2. You grant the project maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
   royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and
   sublicense your contribution — including under licenses other than the AGPL.
3. Your contribution remains available to the community under the AGPL-3.0.

If you can't agree to these terms, please open an issue describing the change
instead of a pull request — reimplementations from descriptions are fine.
